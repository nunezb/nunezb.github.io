I am currently a MSc student at [IMA-PUCV (http://ima.ucv.cl/)]. My research interests lie in dynamical systems and ergodic theory, particularly smooth dynamics, non-invertible systems, cocycles over dynamical systems and continuity and flexibility of their Lyapunov exponents. I also have a broad interest in other geometric and statistical properties of these systems.
